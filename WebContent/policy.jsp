<h3>We collect information in the following ways:</h3>
<p>
<b>	Most of the time readers are not able to contact their favorite authors and express their appreciation.
Authors are not able to receive feedback on their books from legitimate sources.
	Authors do not have many sources to promote their books.
	New publishing companies find the present modes of advertisement expensive.
	Many books are not available in market due to limited copies.
	People have no place to keep old books that they have already read.
	Many talented individuals who aspire to become authors do not have much idea about the whole process of publishing a book.
	Buyers find it difficult to find the website that provides a particular book at the lowest rate.
	Many novice readers do not know which books are worth reading. We collect information to provide better services to all of our users. From figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you will find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.



Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we will ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include your name and photo.

Information we get from your use of our services.  We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:

Device information: We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account.</b></p>
